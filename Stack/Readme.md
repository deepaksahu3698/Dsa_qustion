# Intro to Stack Data Structure 

1. Stacks are data structures, which store in data in LIFO form, where it stands for Last In First Out.
2. The idea is to store the data in such a way, that the element that was inserted at the last, comes out first.
3. An interesting thing to note that, stacks are designed in such a way that they have a single point of entry and exit
4. The single point is used to enter elements into the stack, and pop the elements out of it, and is known as top of the stack
5. There are three basic operations that are performed on the stack, push(), pop(), and peek()
The push() operation is used to add elements at the top of the stack, while the pop() operation is used to remove the elements from top of the stack
6. The peek() operation, returns the value at the top of the stack, without removing it
Care has to be taken that the pop() and peek() operation should not be performed on an empty stack
7. The following code block represents the various operations on the stack.
