# QuickSort Algorithm

Quick sort is based on the divide-and-conquer method based on the idea of choosing one element as a pivot element and partitioning the array around it such that: Left side of pivot contains all the elements that are less than the pivot element Right side contains all elements greater than the pivot.

### Short Explanation

Quick sort reduces the space complexity and removes the use of auxiliary array

One of the most important process of Quick Sort is partition

The goal of partition is to select a pivot and put it at it's correct location in a sorted array, and put all elements smaller than pivot on the left of it and larger on the right of it.
This is done in Linear time.
